- Deliverable: Code and output demonstrating methods for each datatype.
## Assignment No - 3: Data Analysis & Visualization Libraries 📈
- Objective: Work with libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- Numpy (100): Use help(np) and help(np.function_name) to explore functions.
- Pandas (100): Use help(pd) and help(pd.function_name) to explore functions.
- Matplotlib: Draw 10 graphs, ensuring each has proper meaning and context.
- Seaborn: Create 10 meaningful graphs.
- Deliverable: Provide your visualizations and analysis using the libraries.
## Assignment No - 4: Kaggle or Open Datasets 📊
- Objective: Use a real-world dataset from Kaggle or data.gov.in:
- Display the first 5 rows using pandas: df.head().
- Include a statement like: "This is a sample dataset. My complete data shape is data.shape."
- Task: Generate 100 real-world questions based on your dataset.
- Next Step: Solve these questions using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
